text = """The most basic data structure in Python is the sequence. 
Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. 
The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth.
Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common 
ones are lists and tuples, which we would see in this tutorial.
There are certain things you can do with all the sequence types. 
These operations include indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and 
checking for membership. In addition, Python has built-in functions for 
finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest 
and smallest elements."""
